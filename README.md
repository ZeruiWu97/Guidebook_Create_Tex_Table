# A Guidebook to Creating Tex-format Table
Here is a tutorial on how to create a formatted table with Stata or Python. <br>

I rememeber the first time when I was assigned with a data task to replicate a summary statistics table, I wondered whether there was be a command that could automate the formatting, because tables in economics journals look astonishingly similar. I assumed there must be a clean, simple syntax for generating a decent table with just a few small tweaks. But I was quickly disappointed by how few resources I could find online about automating this process. <br>

So, here comes this note, and with two purposes: (1) summarizes some current existing Stata commands, and (2) provides to-go python functions for the readers.  <br>
