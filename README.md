# A guidebook to creating TeX-formatted tables
Here is a tutorial on how to create formatted tables using Stata or Python. <br>

I remember the first time I was assigned a data task to replicate a summary statistics table. I wondered if there was a command that could automate the formatting, especially since tables in economics journals look astonishingly similar. I assumed there had to be a clean, simple syntax for generating a decent table with just a few small tweaks, but I was quickly disappointed by how few resources I could find online about automating the process. It wasn’t beginner-friendly. <br>

So, here comes this note, and with two purposes: 
  - (1) to summarizes some current existing Stata commands, 
  - (2) to provides to-go python functions for the readers.  <br>
